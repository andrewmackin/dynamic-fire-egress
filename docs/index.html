      <h1>Dynamic Fire Egress</h1>
      <p class="lead">For finding the nearest exit when your building is on fire. <br>By: Andrew Mackin (ajm536), David
        Chen (dc854), Hannah Goldstein (hlg66)</p>
    </div>

    <div style="text-align:center;">
      <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">In this project, we simulated the spread of a fire in a building
        and dynamically changed the direction of exit signs based on information on where the fire was. In this way, we
        were able to provide egress routes that prevented individuals from walking through fire if possible.
      </p>
    </div>

    <hr id='intro'>

    <div style="text-align:center;">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;"> In case of an emergency, navigating to the nearest and safest
        exit can prove to be
        difficult when you are in an unfamiliar location or you don’t know the location of the nearest exit that
        avoids the emergency event. The Emergency Egress System provides topological guidance to individuals in a
        building to navigate to the nearest and safest emergency exit through the use of LED arrows attached to exit
        signs. Through an expanded emergency exit sign design, the addition of arrows placed to the left and right of
        the sign, individuals are able to receive real-time guidance for which exit(s) are on the shortest and safest
        path out, and which exits are not.
      </p>
    </div>

    <hr id='design'>

    <div style="text-align:center;padding: 0px 30px;">
      <h2>Design</h2>
      <h3>Physical Model</h3>
      <div style="text-align:center;">
        <img class="img-rounded" src="pics/physical-model.png" style="width:75%;">
        <p>Figure 1: The expected layout of the Exit signs is shown (left), with the top showing arrows pointing right
          and bottom showing arrows pointing left. The produced physical model that was integrated with the physical
          model is shown on the right.</p>
      </div>
      <p style="text-align:left;"> Each of the exit signs is composed of the total of 24 green LEDs
        creating two X’s on mini breadboards. Each
        X is composed of 12 LED’s configured in groups of three such that there is a square in the center of the X
        made from four LED’s (one from each group of three). From this square, the triplets of LED’s are angled evenly
        outward with right angles between each string of LEDs. Figure XX above shows the overall layout of the LEDs on
        the breadboard used to create the Exit signs. Each triplet of LED’s was controlled by a separate GPIO pin
        connected to the RPi4. Each triplet had to be controlled by a separate GPIO pin to avoid maxing out the
        current that the GPIO pins could handle. In addition, because some of the signs never changed because they
        were directly next to a physical exit, the required number of GPIO pins for the model was fewer - summing to a
        total of 14 pins needed for this design (four for both central, navigational signs, and two for each of the
        three physical exit signs)</p>
      <h3>Structuring the Abstract Model</h3>
      <div style="text-align:center;">
        <img class="img-rounded" src="pics/abstract-model.png" style="width:75%;">
        <p>Figure 2: The abstract representation of our demo model of Phillips Hall, Second Floor.</p>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align:left">
        <p>
          We used a graph with various types of nodes and edges to represent the building. We had 4 types of nodes:
        <ul style="text-align:left">
          <li>Exits: Nodes that represented an exit out of the building</li>
          <li>Signs: Nodes that represented a physical sign that could be lit up</li>
          <li>Alarms: Nodes that represented smoke alarms</li>
          <li>Deltas: Intermediate nodes that represented whether a physical path could be safely traversed</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Some nodes, as can be seen in Figure 2, could be both exit and sign nodes if they had a physical sign and
          represented an exit. Then, we had the following rules for edges:</p>
        <ul style="text-align:left">
          <li>A directed edge existed from an Alarm <b>a</b> to a Delta <b>a</b> if and only if fire detected by a
            caused
            the physical
            path represented by <b>d</b> to be unsafe to traverse </li>
          <li>A directed edge existed from Sign <b>s</b> to Delta <b>d</b> if and only if <b>s</b> was not an Exit and
            <b>d</b> was a physically
            directly connected path that could be traveled from s
          </li>
          <li>A directed edge existed from Delta <b>d</b> to Exit <b>e</b> if and only if <b>e</b> was a physically
            directly connected path
            that could be used to travel to <b>e</b></li>
          <li>A directed edge existed from Delta <b>d</b> to Sign <b>s</b> if and only if each other Sign pointing to
            <b>s</b> could route
            people to face the front of <b>s</b> and <b>d</b> was a physically directly connected path that could be
            used
            to get to <b>s</b>
          </li>
          <li>Each Delta node can only have one incoming edge from a Sign node</li>
          <li>Each Delta node can only have on outgoing edge</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Although in Figure 2, all non-exit Signs were directly connected to exits when ignoring Delta nodes, our
          model and algorithm both supported passing multiple non-exit signs on the way to an exit. However, determining
          the new directions would require some small modifications to our code if this were the case.
          Lastly, edges from Delta nodes to Exit nodes carry the physical distance from the Sign incoming into a
          respective Sign node to the respective Exit node. For the most part, this representation went smoothly,
          although as further elaborated in <i>Designing the Algorithm</i>, encoding path lengths in Delta nodes was
          problematic when calculating the shortest path.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>Setting Up the Database</h3>
      <p style="text-align: left">After quite a bit of research, we opted to use a Neo4j database to
        store our graph data. Conveniently, we were
        able to obtain a 30-day free development instance of Neo4j’s AuraDB that we could use to store our data and
        connect remotely. Then, by installing the neo4j Python package using pip, we were able to interface with the
        database remotely, allowing us to perform queries inside of our programs. Lastly, we were able to hide our
        credentials to our database using a .env file that contained the credentials and then load those credentials as
        environment variables using the os package in Python. It took awhile to figure out how to store our Neo4j
        database but once we found AuraDB instances it became clear that it was what we wanted. We tested this step by
        connecting to the database and then executing basic Cypher queries and examining the results in the terminal. It
        was often evident if things were working correctly because verbose error messages would appear otherwise. The
        sample code provided by Neo4j’s Python Developer Guide proved to be very useful for writing the Python code for
        this step.</p>
      <h3> Designing the Algorithm</h3>
      <div style="text-align: left">
        <p>For this, the <a href="https://neo4j.com/graphgists/santas-shortest-weighted-path/"
            target="_blank">Santa’s Shortest Weighted Path</a> blog post proved to be very helpful in
          providing a baseline for the syntax. We ran into issues trying to associate the edge “costs” (or physical
          path distances) in nodes when running our query, but we got around this by storing costs in edges. Our algorithm for calculating the shortest path was as follows:</p>
        <code>MATCH path = (startSign:Sign WHERE startSign.id = $sign_id)-[:CONNECTED_TO*]->(exit:Exit) WHERE NONE
            (x in nodes(path) WHERE x:Fire) RETURN path ORDER BY REDUCE(dist = 0, rela in relationships(path) | dist + rela.cost) ASC LIMIT 1</code>
        <p>where $sign_id represents the identifier for a given Sign node. A breakdown of each step is as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>MATCH path = (startSign:Sign WHERE startSign.id = $sign_id)-[:CONNECTED_TO*]->(exit:Exit)</code>
            <ul>
              <li>Find all paths from a given Sign to an Exit of any length</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><code>WHERE NONE(x in nodes(path) WHERE x:Fire)</code></li>
          <ul>
            <li>Ignore any paths where a (Delta) node has a Fire label associated with it</li>
          </ul>
          <li><code>RETURN path ORDER BY REDUCE(dist = 0, rela in relationships(path) | dist + rela.cost)</code></li>
          <ul>
            <li>Calculate the cost of each edge for a given path in the set of paths created by the query up to this
              point</li>
          </ul>
          <li><code>ASC LIMIT 1</code></li>
          <ul>
            <li>Sort all the paths in ascending order by cost and take the first one (and then return it)</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>Then all we needed to do was compare the old direction to the one associated with the Delta node in the path
          returned by the algorithm to determine if the direction of a sign needed to change. Correctness was evidenced
          through manual testing of our model and by examining the output of the queries.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Interfacing with the LED Signs</h3>
      <p style="text-align:left">Performing this step of the project proved to be quite simple and we ran into no
        significant issues. For each Sign, we added fields which contained the GPIO pin numbers for each quadrant in the
        sign. Then, based on the direction calculated by the algorithm, we sent signals to the LED signs after
        calculating which quadrants needed to be lit. Correctness was evident by simply trying different directions for
        each sign. </p>
      <h3>Networking with Sensors</h3>
      <div style="text-align:center;">
        <img class="img-rounded" src="pics/networking.png" style="width:75%;">
        <p>Figure 3: Networking the Temperature Sensors</p>
      </div>
      <p style="text-align:left">To model the system, we wanted to have the temperature sensors alert the Raspberry Pi
        when there is a fire
        similar to how it would happen with a smoke detector and central monitoring system in an actual building.
        We decided to use the Huzzah ESP8266 breakout which functioned as a networking chip which will relay the
        information from the temperature sensor to the Raspberry Pi. We originally wanted to use HTTP requests, but it
        was simpler
        to use MQTT which was common in IoT devices where suscribers subscribe to certain topics to get certain
        messages. In
        this case, the Raspberry Pi would subscribe to the information from the individual temperature sensors as
        different topics.</p>
      <p style="text-align:left">We originally planned to have one networking chip per sensor, but it would end up being
        too expensive and would
        duplicate
        a lot of the same work on each sensor. One problem we ended up having is we opted to use a cheaper temperature
        sensor which also meant that there was no way to change the I2C address of the sensor. This meant that for the
        single I2C channel on the HUZZAH,
        we had to use a multiplexer, so that it could distinguish between the different sensors as shown in Figure 3.
        This allows the chip to select which
        I2C channel to read from the multiplexer and get the temperature reading for the appropriate sensor.
      </p>

      <hr id='testing'>
      <h2>Testing</h2>
      <p style="text-align: left;">In developing our project, we ran into a number of issues as the
        result of using technologies for the first time and using unreliable parts. With a few minor exceptions, we were
        able to meet all the deadlines we set for ourselves. Oftentimes, the correctness of our sprints was evidenced by
        trivial manual use, although as we put different parts of our project together, we had to manually test
        different patterns of inputs more thoroughly. </p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">In addition, the hardware components were somewhat unreliable such
        as the temperature sensors
        and the I2C multiplexer. Originally, the I2C multiplexer was not working, and it was unable to relay the switch
        between the different I2C channels, so we had to use a different one. In addition, the temperature sensors were
        pretty cheap, so they were somewhat unrealiable in giving readings. There were also many parts that had to be
        connected with wires and unseen loose connections were contributing to the problems we had with the hardware.
        Overall, we were able to test the individual components of the system in isolation first. The networking
        component was tested to see if it could send messages to the Raspberry Pi, the abstract model was checked to see
        if it was generating the correct path based on given inputs, and the LED signs were tested to see if they were
        lighting up correctly. Afterwards, we combined all our different parts to see if all the components worked
        together on our physical model. We were able to see the temperature sensors sending the signal to the Raspberry
        Pi which then controlled the different LEDs to change direction based on the temperature. We concluded our
        testing by ensuring that the paths were changing in the correct manner based on the LEDs and temperature
        readings.</p>
    </div>

    <hr id='result'>

    <div style="text-align:center;">
      <h2>Result</h2>
      <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">All aspects of the project performed as planned in the end. Along
        the way, there were some difficulties and abnormal behavior resulting from either hardware or software issues
        (i.e. dead multiplexer, wires not fully connected/ connected incorrectly, and incorrect entries in the
        database). However, these were resolved and the goals outlined in the description were eventually met. We were
        able to successfully create a model of a building and demonstrate how a dynamic egress system would work to
        change
        exit sign directions based on temperature sensors being triggered.
      </p>
    </div>

    <hr id='conclusion'>

    <div style="text-align:center;">
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;"> Our project was able to model how a dynamic egress system would
        work. It was able to demonstrate what such a system would look like and how it would work. We didn't really run
        into any specific issues that showed that it didn't work. The model was not as complex as how a real building is
        laid out as it only demonstrates the basic components of a system. However, it was able to demonstrate the
        usefulness of such a system on a small scale model that can be extended into a more detailed one.
      </p>
    </div>
    <hr id='future-work'>

    <div style="text-align:center;">
      <h2>Future Work</h2>
      <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;"> For future work, trying models to add more complex paths to the
        exits (multiple intermediary signs, for example) and larger data would be an option. In addition, displaying the
        path on the piTFT screen for a visual layout would also be an ideal extension for more complex buildings. In
        addition, interfacing between either the heat sensors or the exit signs wirelessly would also increase the
        usability and reduce the number of hardware issues that were encountered. Furthermore, incorporating paths from
        multiple floors and buildings with more complex layouts would allow for the expansion of the project and the
        development of a design that could be incorporated into any building just using the location of sensors, signs,
        and exits. With this increased complexity in floors and buildings, investigating how to leverage the carrying
        capacity of hallways and to reduce congestion for larger buildings is also a future consideration.
